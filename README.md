# Trivia App

A fun, interactive Trivia App built with **React** and powered by the **Open Trivia Database API**. This project, developed in **October 2024**, served as a hands-on learning experience for working with APIs and integrating them into React applications.

## Project Timeline

Created in October 2024, this project focused on learning how to:
- **Understand API Structures**: Learned the basics of REST APIs, including how endpoints, requests, and responses work.
- **Fetch and Use API Data**: Used the Open Trivia Database API to fetch trivia questions, parse the responses, and integrate them dynamically into the app.
- **React Component Development**: Built and organized React components to create an interactive quiz interface.
- **State Management**: Managed and updated component state to handle gameplay, scoring, and answer selection.
  
## Features
- **Trivia Questions**: Questions are fetched from [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) with various categories and difficulty levels.
- **Answer Validation**: Displays feedback on correct and incorrect answers.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks and displays the user’s score throughout the quiz session.

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run the project locally:

**Clone the repository**:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/truongblake/trivia-app.git
  cd trivia-app
```
Install dependencies:

    npm install

Run the application:

    npm start

Access the app: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Learning Outcome

Through this project, I gained experience in:

- API Integration in React: Learned to fetch data asynchronously using JavaScript’s fetch API and handle responses.
- Working with JSON Data: Parsed JSON data from API responses to display questions and answers dynamically.
- React Basics and Hooks: Improved my understanding of core React concepts, such as component-based architecture, useState, and useEffect.
- Error Handling: Implemented basic error handling to manage API response issues and network errors.
